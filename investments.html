                    <li class="list-body">
                        We believe that to accurately tell your story, there is no reason to
                        cut short the moments that go into it. For this reason, our local wedding
                        packages give you options to provide enough time to capture each essential moment
                        of your day. We often recommend at least 8 hours of coverage to fully
                        capture the day's adventures, however, we understand that budget or event
                        constaints may not be conducive to 8 or more hours. Thus, we offer flexible
                        packages to fit your individual needs.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-head">An Engagement Session:</li>
                    <li class="list-body">
                        This comes with every package booked. We feel this not only gives us a chance to get to
                        know your story before the big day, but it also allows YOU the time beforehand to relax
                        and become more comfortable in front of the camera. This gives both of us the time to build
                        a personal relationship and for us to give you photographs that matter.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-head">Optional Second Photographer:</li>
                    <li class="list-body">
                        Every wedding we work together as a team! However, we don't require that you hire both of
                        us to photograph your special day. Ashley has photographed many weddings herself, with Daniel
                        there to provide an extra eye for angles, to straighten the occasional tie, or to direct groups where they
                        need to be. That being said, we do recommend taking advantage of having a second photographer,
                        as there are so many moments you will not see as the bride or groom that we are able to
                        capture as a team. Having two cameras and perspectives allows us to photograph more of your
                        story than any one person could do on their own.

                    <li class="list-head">Printing and Digital Use Rights:</li>
                    <li class="list-body">
                        All processed images are delivered via an online gallery. Every image you receive is finished,
                        without watermark and in high resolution. From your gallery you can directly download each image
                        for printing and sharing. You are allowed to print as many of your photos as you want,
                        as many times as you want without limit. You also are able to share your photos online
                        and on social media with proper photo credit. We don't guarantee any specific number of finished photos,
                        but our general range is between 500-800.

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0px;">
                    We believe that it is important for you to find a photographer that captures moments in a way
                    that you appreciate aesthetically, but that also connects with your vision for remembering your story.
                    We try to keep a variety of photos in our portfolio so that you have a clear visual of the
                    different sessions we have photographed, but we've also answered a few questions below to
                    help you decide if we are the right photographers for you. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-head">How many photos do you usually deliver and how soon will we receive them after our wedding or session?</li>
                    <li class="list-body">
                        Every session is different, so we don't like to place a number on how many photos you will
                        receive. We aren't trying to meet a quota, but rather give you the best representation
                        of your story. That being said, on average most wedding galleries are between 500-800 photos,
                        and between 50-100 photos for an hour-long session. Turn-around time is between
                        4-6 weeks, but we do our best to get them to you as quickly as possible. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-head">Is your business insured and how do you protect your photos?</li>
                    <li class="list-body">
                        Yes, we are insured through PPA and carry both liability and equipment insurance for both
                        local and destination sessions/weddings. The only reason you would not receive your photos
                        would be if our memory cards or cameras were stolen&mdash;which would be a very rare circumstance.
                        We use a dual memory card slot in our cameras to make sure that we have two cards with your images;
                        and we backup your photos on two separate hard drives immediately after a session or wedding to make
                        sure that your images are protected.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-head">What do we need to do to book our date?</li>
                    <li class="list-body">
                        Once we send you the contract, there is a grace period of up to 10 days for you to sign
                        and return the contract along with a 25% non-refundable retainer in order to book your date.
                        The rest of the payment is due on the day of the session or wedding. We do not take credit cards,
                        only cash or check. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-head">What does "Full Day Coverage" mean for weddings?</li>
                    <li class="list-body">
                        Full day coverage means that rather than charging you per hour, we are there from the getting ready to the send off.
                        While every wedding is different, as a general guideline we plan to arrive when the bridal party is almost finished
                        with hair and makeup, and we stay until all the planned evening events are finished.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-head">What is your booking process?</li>
                    <li class="list-body">
                        We try to answer as many basic questions here on our page, understanding that if you live out-of-state then
                        a face to face meeting would be very difficult. Before booking we will set up a phone
                        call to hear your story and to go over the details of both the contract and your vision for your session or wedding.
                        After that, we will send you the contract to be signed and returned along with your retainer.
                        Once you have booked with us, we will set up a Skype or video call to get to know you a little better
                        and start building the relationship that allows us to capture your story authentically. If you're local or
                        visiting the area, then we would always love to sit down with you at a local coffee shop and go over details in person! 
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-head">We are having a local wedding, but we are doing a destination honeymoon/engagement session. Will you travel for those?</li>
                    <li class="list-body">
                        Absolutely! We would love to adventure with you! We have had the privilege of going on several
                        destination honeymoons and capturing some of the off-road adventures our couples have enjoyed together.
                        There is often less stress and planning for these sessions and more time to capture just the two of you. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-head">What are the costs for your destination packages?</li>
                    <li class="list-body">
                        We don't offer set prices for destination weddings as there are many variables involved.
                        Location, duration, and travel expenses all factor into the package cost. Our goal is
                        to make photographing your adventure affordable, so don't hesitate to let us know your budget.
                        There are often many ways to save on expenses for destination elopements or weddings and we would love to work with you!
