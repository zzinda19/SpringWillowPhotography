                Our passion for photography began after we received our own wedding photos.
                Looking through those memories stirred such deep emotions in our hearts. Our
                photographer pictured our day as a story, beautifully capturing our love for each
                other without making us feel uncomfortable or posed. She had given us one of
                the most precious gifts we could have ever asked for that day&mdash;one that will
                let us relive those moments for the rest of our lives. Our heart is to give
                that same experience to you. Whether we are capturing senior portraits or
                your wedding day, our desire is to give you a storybook of memories. We are
                only given today, tomorrow is never guaranteed, our lives are made up of
                constantly changing seasons. Photographs give us the ability to freeze a glimpse
                in time so that when future seasons come, we can look back and experience once more
                the journeys we have been on.

                For this reason, we don't use a studio location with lots of backgrounds and lights or
                ask you to look at the camera and smile for every photo. We will capture your list of
                desired portraits, but we also believe that the best images we can capture are when you
                are are simply being yourself. We will give direction when needed, (we definitely understand
                how uncomfortable it can initially feel to be in front of a camera!) but rather than posing
                every minute of your session, we want you to feel relaxed and connected with what is going
                on around you.

                We believe that every couple, every person, and every family has a unique and beautiful story.
                We love connecting with you as we learn about your story and adventures in life. We feel that the best way for
                us to capture who you are is to be personal. We love hearing your stories; each tells of the road you have been on to
                bring you to this chapter in your life. We aren't interested in simply showing up on a certain day, clicking
                a few photographs and then delivering them a few weeks later. If that's what you're looking for you, we are not
                the photographers for you. We want to give you a personal collection of photographs that allow you to share
                a chapter of your lives for generations to come. We want to give you the memories that will last a lifetime.
