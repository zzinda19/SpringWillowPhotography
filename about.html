                    Our passion for photography began after we received our own wedding photos.
                    Looking through those memories stirred such deep emotions in our hearts. Our
                    photographer pictured our day as a story, beautifully capturing our love for each
                    other without making us feel uncomfortable or posed. She had given us one of
                    the most precious gifts we could have ever asked for that day&mdash;one that will
                    let us relive those moments for the rest of our lives. Our heart is to give
                    that same experience to you. Whether we are capturing senior portraits or
                    your wedding day, our desire is to give you a storybook of memories. We are
                    only given today, tomorrow is never guaranteed, our lives are made up of
                    constantly changing seasons. Photographs give us the ability to freeze a glimpse
                    in time so that when future seasons come, we can look back and experience once more
                    the journeys we have been on.

                    For this reason, we don't use a studio location with lots of backgrounds and lights or
                    ask you to look at the camera and smile for every photo. We will capture your list of
                    desired portraits, but we also believe that the best images we can capture are when you
                    are are simply being yourself. We will give direction when needed, (we definitely understand
                    how uncomfortable it can initially feel to be in front of a camera!) but rather than posing
                    every minute of your session, we want you to feel relaxed and connected with what is going
                    on around you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that every couple, every person, and every family has a unique and beautiful story.
                    We love connecting with you as we learn about your story and adventures in life. We feel that the best way for
                    us to capture who you are is to be personal. We love hearing your stories; each tells of the road you have been on to
                    bring you to this chapter in your life. We aren't interested in simply showing up on a certain day, clicking
                    a few photographs and then delivering them a few weeks later. If that's what you're looking for you, we are not
                    the photographers for you. We want to give you a personal collection of photographs that allow you to share
                    a chapter of your lives for generations to come. We want to give you the memories that will last a lifetime.
